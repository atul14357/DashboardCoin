# JavaScript-Crytpo-Dashboard

I have created A Dashboard using ApexCharts.js charting library. 

For Server I used Node.js and all the data which is being visualized is coming from Coingeko's API : 
https://www.coingecko.com/en/api.

Data related to Cryptocurrency Market is being visualized here. Its one of the greatest way to actually, analyze market data. Instead of JSON data I would prefer looking around a graph.

# How to Run the program
-> open your terminal
-> Go inside your files located this project
-> Run # npm install
-> Then # node .\index.js and open localhost:3000 in your browser
